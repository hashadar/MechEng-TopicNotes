\section{Summary of tasks and contributions to the team work up to date}
As the team leader, I have taken on many responsibilities relating to the project. I have been arranging the team meetings between ourselves and with Ivan (Massive Analytic). I also am responsible for leading these meetings, creating agendas and managing the team's immediate action points and long term goals. Predominantly, the team would split into pairs to work on different aspects of a goal at once, or multiple goals at the same time. Currently, I am researching on how to implement the simulation environment within our workflow. This will be discussed further in Section \ref{methods}. 

The Belbin Assessment was part of our first week's formative assessment, and during this I organised a meeting between ourselves to introduce one another and discuss the project. The team was required to send a document outlining the personality types of the group to Dr Bele. I collated each individuals results into one document and created the necessary charts and figures. This was sent on time to Dr Bele. 

The Initial Progress Report was our first summative assignment and I was responsible for splitting up the work between the team. I was also responsible for writing the introduction, individual and team responsibilities, plan of work and deliverables sections. I was also responsible for the formatting and final editing of the assignment, having decided to typeset in \LaTeX. In an initial meeting, I decided to split the work up into two phases: a research phase and a writing phase. I organised the team to research different aspects of the project and to then write different sections of the coursework.
