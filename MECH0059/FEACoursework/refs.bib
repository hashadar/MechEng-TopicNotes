    abstract = {Current use of the finite element method in engineering practice is considered. The increasing use of finite element analysis in a CAD environment and factors influencing it are discussed. The technological state of the art is briefly reviewed. Special consideration is given to shell elements and solution methods, illustrating the progress being made in these and other areas of finite element technology. Future trends are predicted.}

    abstract = {Currently, the use of the personal computer and the personal engineering workstation is rapidly increasing. However, many engineers are not aware of the power and flexibility that they offer. These systems can offer support for important engineering software such as finite element analysis (FEA) and computer aided design (CAD). This work will cover current capabilities in these areas, discuss their interaction, and predict some trends in capabilities for the personal computers.}
