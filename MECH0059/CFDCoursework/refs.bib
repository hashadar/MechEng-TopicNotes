    abstract = { Background and Purpose—The estimates on the prevalence and the risk of rupture of intracranial saccular aneurysms vary widely between studies. We conducted a systematic review on prevalence and risk of rupture of intracranial aneurysms and classified the data according to study design, study population, and aneurysm characteristics. Methods—We searched for studies published between 1955 and 1996 by means of a MEDLINE search and a cumulative review of the reference lists of all relevant publications. Two authors independently assessed eligibility of all studies and extracted data on study design and on numbers and characteristics of patients and aneurysms. Results—For data on prevalence we found 23 studies, totalling 56 304 patients; 6685 (12\%) of these patients were from 15 angiography studies. Prevalence was 0.4\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.4\% to 0.5\%) in retrospective autopsy studies, 3.6\% (3.1 to 4.1) for prospective autopsy studies, 3.7\% (3.0 to 4.4) in retrospective angiography studies, and 6.0\% (5.3 to 6.8) in prospective angiography studies. For adults without specific risk factors, the prevalence was 2.3\% (1.7 to 3.1); it tended to increase with age. The prevalence was higher in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (relative risk [RR], 4.4 [2.7 to 7.2]), a familial predisposition (RR, 4.0 [2.7 to 6.0]), or atherosclerosis (RR, 2.3 [1.7 to 3.1]). Only 8\% (5 to 11) of the aneurysms were \&gt;10 mm. For the risk of rupture, we found nine studies, totalling 3907 patient-years. The overall risk per year was 1.9\% (1.5 to 2.4); for aneurysms =10 mm, the annual risk was 0.7\% (0.5 to 1.0). The risk was higher in women (RR, 2.1[1.1 to 3.9]) and for aneurysms that were symptomatic (RR, 8.3 [4.0 to 17]), \&gt;10 mm (RR, 5.5 [3.3 to 9.4]), or in the posterior circulation (RR, 4.1 [1.5 to 11]). Conclusions—Data on prevalence and risk of rupture vary considerably according to study design, study population, and aneurysm characteristics. If all available evidence with inherent overestimation and underestimation is taken together, for adults without risk factors for subarachnoid hemorrhage, aneurysms are found in approximately 2\%. The vast majority of these aneurysms are small (=10 mm) and have an annual risk of rupture of approximately 0.7\%. }

    abstract  = {Endovascular coil embolisation is increasingly used to treat unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Endovascular coil embolisation of UIA is associated with a 5{\textendash}10\% risk of morbidity and nearly zero mortality from the procedure. Complete or near complete occlusion is usually achieved in \&gt;90\% of cases, and endovascular therapy seems to reduce the risk of future rupture significantly. Specific selection criteria for endovascular embolisation and novel approaches to endovascular treatment of aneurysms are discussed. Endovascular therapy appears to be a safe and effective treatment for selected UIA. Treatment failure rates will probably decrease with greater experience and advances in techniques and devices. Further study with long term follow up, however, is still necessary to characterise the efficacy, durability, and cost efficiency of endovascular treatment of UIA.},

    abstract = { Unruptured intracranial aneurysms often have a relatively benign clinical course. Frequently, they are found incidentally during workup for an underlying, possibly related or unrelated, symptom or condition. Overall, brain aneurysms are considered to have a relatively low annual risk of rupture. However, should it occur, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Our understanding of the natural history and treatment outcomes of cerebral aneurysms has significantly increased over the last few decades, but choosing the optimal management for each patient requires the careful consideration of numerous medical, clinical and anatomic factors. The purpose of this review is to help physicians and caregivers, who may participate in the diagnosis, counseling and triage of patients with brain aneurysms, understand the basic elements of decision making. We discuss natural history, risk factors, screening, presentation, diagnosis, and their implications on aneurysm management and long-term follow-up. We also provide an overview of the risks and benefits of currently available treatment options. }

    abstract  = {Objective This study aimed to predict recurrence after coil embolization of unruptured cerebral aneurysms with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using porous media modeling (porous media CFD).   Method A total of 37 unruptured cerebral aneurysms treated with coiling were analyzed using follow-up angiograms, simulated CFD prior to coiling (control CFD), and porous media CFD. Coiled aneurysms were classified into stable or recurrence groups according to follow-up angiogram findings. Morphological parameters, coil packing density, and hemodynamic variables were evaluated for their correlations with aneurysmal recurrence. We also calculated residual flow volumes (RFVs), a novel hemodynamic parameter used to quantify the residual aneurysm volume after simulated coiling, which has a mean fluid domain > 1.0 cm/s.   Result Follow-up angiograms showed 24 aneurysms in the stable group and 13 in the recurrence group. Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated that maximum size, dome volume, neck width, neck area, and coil packing density were significantly different between the two groups (P < 0.05). Among the hemodynamic parameters, aneurysms in the recurrence group had significantly larger inflow and outflow areas in the control CFD and larger RFVs in the porous media CFD. Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that RFV was the only independently significant factor (odds ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.11; P = 0.016).   Conclusion The study findings suggest that RFV collected under porous media modeling predicts the recurrence of coiled aneurysms.},
