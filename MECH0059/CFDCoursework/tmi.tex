\begin{abstract}
    This assignment investigates the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to analyse the haemodynamics of cerebral aneurysyms when treated via endovascular coil emboilsation. I utilise a simplfied model of a basilar bifurcated artery with a saccular aneurysm for this assignment. The area where coils are inserted are modelled as a porous medium and my results show a positive change in the haemodynamics of the artery. Specifically, the flow of blood and pressure is reduced to negligible in the saccular region of the aneurysm and the flow through the bifurcartion is much improved. The results show that coil emboilisation can be an effective treatment for a cerebral aneurysm - preventing it from growing or rupturing. This assignment simplifies the problem as to place emphasis on the ``CFD workflow,'' and to emulate the experience of an industrial engineer or researcher using CFD for a project.

\section{Introduction}
Cerebral aneurysms are formed due to the detoriation of the normal arterial structure leading to a dilation or bulge in the vessel wall, typically called a sac. The development of a saccular cerebral aneurysm (accounting for 90\% of cases) occurs in approximately 3\% to 5\% of the general population - the majority of which are asymptomatic \cite{saccularAneurysm, doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.113.002390}. However, there is a risk of rupture of the aneurysm in approximately 2\% to 6\% of cases leading to significant intercranial bleeding \cite{doi:10.1161/01.STR.29.1.251}. In most cases, the diagnosis is a subarachnoid hemmorage (SAH), with mostly fatal or life-altering prognoses: between 25\% to 50\% of SAH are fatal, with another 50\% resulting in disability \cite{intracranialAneurysms}.

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} document is a template for \LaTeX.
You are encouraged to use it to prepare your manuscript.
If you are reading a paper or PDF version of this document, please download the
\LaTeX .zip file from the IEEE Web site at \underline
{https://www.embs.org/tmi/authors-instructions/} to prepare your manuscript.

\section{Guidelines for Manuscript Preparation}
Do not change the template font sizes or line spacing to squeeze more text into a limited number of pages.
The preferred font is 10-pt Times New Roman. Use italics for emphasis; do not underline words.

Place your figures in the text as you expect them to appear in print. Further instructions
on figure usage appear in Section VI. Although IEEE will do the final formatting of your paper,
we expect you to approximate the final form appearance for all versions
submitted to TMI via ScholarOne\textregistered to the extent possible.

\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}
Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
even after they have already been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations
such as IEEE, SI, ac, and dc do not have to be defined. Abbreviations that
incorporate periods should not have spaces: write ``C.N.R.S.,'' not ``C. N.
R. S.'' Do not use abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable
(for example, ``IEEE'' in the title of this article).

\subsection{Other Recommendations}
Use one space after periods and colons. Hyphenate complex modifiers:
``zero-field-cooled magnetization.'' Avoid dangling participles, such as,
``Using \eqref{eq}, the potential was calculated.'' It is not clear who or what
used \eqref{eq}. Write instead, ``The potential was calculated by using \eqref{eq},'' or
``Using \eqref{eq}, we calculated the potential.''

Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25,'' not ``.25.'' Use
``cm$^{3}$,'' not ``cc.'' Indicate sample dimensions as ``0.1 cm
$\times $ 0.2 cm,'' not ``0.1 $\times $ 0.2 cm$^{2}$.'' The
abbreviation for ``seconds'' is ``s,'' not ``sec.'' Use
``Wb/m$^{2}$'' or ``webers per square meter,'' not
``webers/m$^{2}$.'' When expressing a range of values, write ``7 to
9'' or ``7--9,'' not ``7$\sim $9.''

A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of
the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated
within the parentheses.) In American English, periods and commas are located within
quotation marks, like ``this period.'' Other punctuation is placed ``outside''!
Avoid contractions; for example, write ``do not'' instead of ``don't.'' The
serial comma is preferred: ``A, B, and C'' instead of ``A, B and C.''

If you wish, you may write in the first person singular or plural form using
the active voice (``I observed that $\ldots$'' or ``We observed that $\ldots$''
instead of ``It was observed that $\ldots$''). Remember to check spelling. If
your native language is not English, please have a native English-speaking
colleague to carefully proofread your paper.

\section{Math}
\subsection{Equations}
Number equations consecutively with equation numbers in parentheses flush
with the right margin, as appears in \eqref{eq}. Refer to ``\eqref{eq},'' not ``Eq. \eqref{eq}''
or ``equation \eqref{eq},'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq}
is $\ldots$ .'' To make your equations more
compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or appropriate
exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate
equations when they are part of a sentence, as in
\begin{equation}E=mc^2.\label{eq}\end{equation}

Be sure to define the symbols in your equation before the equation appears or
immediately following. Italicize symbols ($T$ might refer
to temperature, but T is the unit tesla).

\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

Use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). This will make it possible
to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
citations without having to manually change equation references.

Do not use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

Note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
equation numbers displayed.

    {\BibTeX} only functions in conjunction with local .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce the
bibliography you must attach the .bib files.

    {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to both a
subsubsection and a table, you may find that Table I has been cross
referenced as Table IV-B3.

{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| and it might stop a
wanted equation number in the surrounding equation.

If you are submitting your paper to a colorized journal, you can use
the following two lines at the start of the article to ensure its
appearance resembles the final copy:

\smallskip\noindent
\begin{small}
    \begin{tabular}{l}
        \verb+\+\texttt{documentclass[journal,twoside,web]\{ieeecolor\}} \\
        \verb+\+\texttt{usepackage\{\textit{Journal\_Name}\}}
    \end{tabular}
\end{small}

\section{Units}
Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are strongly
encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses).
For example, write ``1 kg (2.2lb).'' An exception exists for when
English units are used as identifiers in commercial products, such as a ``3\textonehalf-in
disk drive.'' Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes
and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because
equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly
state the units for each quantity in an equation.

The SI unit for magnetic field strength $H$ is A/m. However, if you wish to use
units of T, either refer to magnetic flux density $B$ or magnetic field
strength symbolized as $\mu _{0}H$. Use the center dot to separate
compound units, e.g., ``A$\cdot $m$^{2}$.''

\subsection{Types of Graphics}
The following list outlines the different types of graphics published in
IEEE journals. They are categorized based on their construction, and use of
color~/~shades of gray:

\subsubsection{Color/Grayscale figures}
{Figures that are meant to appear in color, or shades of black/gray. Such
    figures may include photographs, illustrations, multicolor graphs, and
    flowcharts.}

\subsubsection{Line Art figures}
{Figures that are composed of only black lines and shapes. These figures
    should have no shades or half-tones of gray, only black and white.}

\subsubsection{Author photos}
{Not allowed for papers in TMI.}

\subsubsection{Tables}
{Data charts which are typically black and white, but sometimes include
    color.}

\subsection{Multipart figures}
Multipart figures are comprised of more than one sub-figure presented together.
If a multipart figure is made up of multiple figure types (one part is lineart,
and another is grayscale or color) the figure should meet the strictest applicable guidelines.

\subsection{File Formats For Graphics}
\label{formats}
Format and save your graphics as one of the following approved file types:
PostScript (.PS), Encapsulated PostScript (.EPS), Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF),
Portable Document Format (.PDF), Portable Network Graphics (.PNG), or Metapost (.MPS).
After the paper is accepted, any included graphics must be submitted alongside the final manuscript files.

\subsection{Sizing of Graphics}
Most charts, graphs, and tables are one column wide (3.5 inches~/~88
millimeters) or page wide (7.16 inches~/~181 millimeters). The maximum
depth of a graphic is 8.5 inches (216 millimeters). When choosing the depth of a graphic,
please allow space for a caption. Authors are allowed to size figures between column and
page widths, but it is recommended not to size figures less than column width unless necessary.

\subsection{Resolution}
The proper resolution of your figures will depend on the type of figure it
is as defined in the ``Types of Figures'' section. Author photographs,
color, and grayscale figures should be at least 300dpi. Lineart, including
tables should be a minimum of 600dpi.

\subsection{Vector Art}
While IEEE does accept and even recommends that authors submit artwork
in vector format, it is our policy is to rasterize all figures for publication. This is done
in order to preserve figures' integrity across multiple computer platforms.

\subsection{Colorspace}
The term colorspace refers to the entire sum of colors that can be
represented within a given medium. For our purposes, the three main colorspaces
are grayscale, RGB (red/green/blue) and CMYK (cyan/magenta/yellow/black).
RGB is generally used with on-screen graphics, whereas CMYK is used for printing purposes.

All color figures should be generated in RGB or CMYK colorspace. Grayscale
images should be submitted in grayscale colorspace. Line art may be
provided in grayscale OR bitmap colorspace. Note that ``bitmap colorspace''
and ``bitmap file format'' are not the same thing. When bitmap colorspace
is selected, .TIF/.TIFF are the recommended file formats.

\subsection{Accepted Fonts Within Figures}
When preparing your graphics IEEE suggests that you use of one of the
following Open Type fonts: Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, Cambria, and
Symbol. If you are supplying EPS, PS, or PDF files all fonts must be
embedded. Some fonts may only be native to your operating system; without
the fonts embedded, parts of the graphic may be distorted or missing.

A safe option when finalizing your figures is to strip out the fonts before
you save the files, creating ``outline'' type. This converts fonts to
artwork that will appear uniformly on any screen.

\subsection{Using Labels Within Figures}

\subsubsection{Figure Axis labels}
Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than
symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,'' or
``Magnetization M,'' not just ``M.'' Put units in parentheses. Do not label
axes only with units. As in Fig. 1, for example, write ``Magnetization
(A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A$\cdot$m$^{-1}$),'' not just ``A/m.''
Do not label axes with a ratio of quantities and units.
For example, write ``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or
``Magnetization (10$^{3}$ A/m).'' Do not write ``Magnetization
(A/m)$\,\times\,$1000'' because the reader would not know whether the top
axis label in Fig. 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be
legible, approximately 8 to 10 point type.

\subsubsection{Subfigure Labels in Multipart Figures and Tables}
Multipart figures should be combined and labeled before final submission.
Labels should appear centered below each subfigure in 8 point Times New
Roman font in the format of (a) (b) (c).

\subsection{Referencing a Figure or Table Within Your Paper}
When referencing your figures and tables within your paper, use the
abbreviation ``Fig.'' even at the beginning of a sentence. Do not abbreviate
``Table.'' Tables should be numbered with Roman numerals.

\subsection{Submitting Your Graphics}
Format your paper with the graphics included within the body of the text
as you would expect to see the paper in print. Please do this at each stage of the review,
from first submission to final files. For final files only, after the paper has been accepted
for publication, figures should also be submitted individually in addition to the manuscript
file using one of the approved file formats. Place a figure caption below each figure;
place table titles above the tables. Do not include captions or borders in the uploaded figure files.

\subsection{File Naming}
Figures (line artwork or images) should be named starting with the
first 5 letters of the corresponding author's last name. The next characters in the
filename should be the number that represents the figure's sequential
location in the article. For example, in author ``Anderson's'' paper,
the first three figures might be named ander1.tif, ander2.tif, and ander3.ps.

Tables should contain only the body of the table (not the caption) and
should be named similarly to figures, except that `.t' is inserted
in-between the author's name and the table number. For example, author
Anderson's first three tables would be named ander.t1.tif, ander.t2.ps, ander.t3.eps.

Author photographs or biographies are not permitted in IEEE TMI papers.

\subsection{Checking Your Figures: The IEEE Graphics Analyzer}
The IEEE Graphics Analyzer enables authors to pre-screen their graphics for
compliance with IEEE Transactions and Journals standards before submission.
The online tool, located at \underline{http://graphicsqc.ieee.org/},
allows authors to upload their graphics in order to check that each file is the correct file format,
resolution, size and colorspace; that no fonts are missing or corrupt;
that figures are not compiled in layers or have transparency,
and that they are named according to the IEEE Transactions and Journals naming convention.
At the end of this automated process, authors are provided with
a detailed report on each graphic within the web applet, as well as by email.

For more information on using the Graphics Analyzer or any other graphics
related topic, contact the IEEE Graphics Help Desk by e-mail at
graphics@ieee.org.

\subsection{Color Processing/Printing in IEEE Journals}
All IEEE Transactions, Journals, and Letters allow an author to publish
color figures on IEEE Xplore\textregistered\ at no charge, and automatically
convert them to grayscale for print versions. In most journals, figures and
tables may alternatively be printed in color if an author chooses to do so.
Please note that this service comes at an extra expense to the author. If
you intend to have print color graphics, include a note with your final
paper indicating which figures or tables you would like to be handled that way,
and stating that you are willing to pay the additional fee.

\section{Some Common Mistakes}
The word ``data'' is plural, not singular. The subscript for the
permeability of vacuum $\mu _{0}$ is zero, not a lowercase letter
``o.'' Use the word ``micrometer'' instead of ``micron.'' A graph within a graph is an
``inset,'' not an ``insert.'' The word ``alternatively'' is preferred to the
word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates). Use
the word ``whereas'' instead of ``while'' (unless you are referring to
simultaneous events). Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean
``approximately'' or ``effectively.'' Do not use the word ``issue'' as a
euphemism for ``problem.'' When compositions are not specified, separate
chemical symbols by en-dashes; for example, ``NiMn'' indicates the
intermetallic compound Ni$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$ whereas
``Ni--Mn'' indicates an alloy of some composition
Ni$_{x}$Mn$_{1-x}$.

Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' (usually a
verb) and ``effect'' (usually a noun), ``complement'' and ``compliment,''
``discreet'' and ``discrete,'' ``principal'' (e.g., ``principal
investigator'') and ``principle'' (e.g., ``principle of measurement''). Do
not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer.''

Prefixes such as ``non,'' ``sub,'' ``micro,'' ``multi,'' and ``ultra'' are
not independent words; they should be joined to the words they modify,
usually without a hyphen. There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin
abbreviation ``\emph{et al.}'' (it is also italicized). The abbreviation ``i.e.,'' means
``that is,'' and the abbreviation ``e.g.,'' means ``for example'' (these
abbreviations are not italicized).

\section{Conclusion}
A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the
main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion.
A conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest
applications and extensions.

\appendices

\section*{Appendix and the Use of Supplemental Files}
Appendices, if needed, appear before the acknowledgment. If an appendix is not
critical to the main message of the manuscript and is included only for thoroughness
or for reader reference, then consider submitting appendices as supplemental materials.
Supplementary files are available to readers through IEEE \emph{Xplore\textregistered}
at no additional cost to the authors but they do not appear in print versions.
Supplementary files must be uploaded in ScholarOne as supporting documents, but for
accepted papers they should be uploaded as Multimedia documents. Refer readers
to the supplementary files where appropriate within the manuscript text using footnotes.
\footnote{Supplementary materials are available in the supporting documents/multimedia tab.
    Further instructions on footnote usage are in the Footnotes section on the next page.}

\section*{Acknowledgment}
The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in American English is
without an ``e'' after the ``g.'' Use the singular heading even if you have
many acknowledgments. Avoid expressions such as ``One of us (S.B.A.) would
like to thank $\ldots$ .'' Instead, write ``F. A. Author thanks $\ldots$ .'' In most
cases, sponsor and financial support acknowledgments are placed in the
unnumbered footnote on the first page, not here.

\section*{References and Footnotes}

\subsection{References}
All listed references must be cited in text at least once. Use number citations
that are placed in square brackets and inside the punctuation.

Multiple references are each numbered with separate brackets.
When citing a section in a book, please give the relevant page numbers.
In text, refer simply to the reference number. Do not use ``Ref.'' or
``reference'' except at the beginning of a sentence:
``Reference \cite{b3} shows $\ldots$ .'

Reference numbers are set flush left and form a column of their own, hanging
out beyond the body of the reference. The reference numbers are on the line,
enclosed in square brackets. In all references, the given name of the author
or editor is abbreviated to the initial only and precedes the last name.
List the names of all authors if there are six or fewer co-authors,
otherwise list the primary author's name followed by \emph{at al.}
Use commas around Jr., Sr., and III in names. Abbreviate conference titles.
When citing IEEE transactions, provide the issue number, page range, volume number,
year, and/or month if available. When referencing a patent, provide the day and
month of issue or application. References may not include all information;
please obtain and include relevant information. Do not combine references.
There must be only one reference with each number. If there is a
URL included with the print reference, it can be included at the end of the reference.

Other than books, capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except
for proper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in translation
journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original
foreign-language citation. See the end of this document for formats and
examples of common references. For a complete discussion of references and
their formats, see the IEEE style manual at
\underline{https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/your-role-in-article-p}
\discretionary{}{}{}\underline{roduction/ieee-editorial-style-manual/}.

\subsection{Footnotes}
Number footnotes separately using superscripts.\footnote{Place the actual
    footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put
    footnotes in the reference list (endnotes).}
It is recommended that footnotes be avoided (except for
the unnumbered footnote with the receipt date on the first page).
Instead, try to integrate the footnote information into the text.
Use letters for table footnotes (see Table \ref{table}).
