  abstract = {This article presents a strength analysis of the rear wheel hub of the prototype vehicle for the Shell Eco-Marathon competition. Due to only one wheel in the vehicle's driving axle, all drive components and the wheel are subjected to higher loads. Therefore, the rear hub must withstand the loads generated by the rear part of the vehicle and the powertrain. The aim of the paper was to develop a hub with the minimum possible weight while fulfilling the strength conditions. The low weight of the hub is particularly important because of the efforts to achieve the highest possible efficiency of the drive system, which generates less energy loss and the ability to travel a longer distance on the same amount of fuel. The article presents the developed three-dimensional model of the hub. The suitable materials for the individual elements that are parts of the whole hub were selected. The three-dimensional model was tested to strength analysis using the finite element method with the use of Abaqus® software. The developed calculation mesh as well as the assumptions and boundary conditions of the modelling carried out are presented. The results of the simulation tests, which are the basis for further design work are also described.},

Moving body profile controls fuel the consumption rate. This paper discusses a novel car profile consisting of two airfoils Roncz (car profile) and National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics NACA 10 (car sides). They are used to create a streamlined body. Three-Dimensional numerical simulations of the full scale model (half domain) are performed to examine the effect of car profile on the drag coefficient and thus fuel consumption. Simulations are considered over a range of air flow velocities, from 20 to 45 km/h in a step of 5 km/h. The ahmed body is used to validate the results. Results are shown graphically for coefficients of drag and lift and pressure and velocity contours. They show that the design of the car profile is effective.},

The vehicle is especially developed for the student competition Shell Eco-marathon in the Urban Concept category. In order to minimize the driving energy consumption a simulation model of the vehicle and the electric propulsion is developed. The model is based on vehicle dynamics and real motor efficiency as constant DC/DC, motor controllers and transmission efficiency were considered. Based on that model five propulsion schemes and driving strategies were evaluated. The fuel cell output parameters were experimentally determined. Then, the driving energy demand and hydrogen consumption was estimated for each of the propulsion schemes. Finally, an experimental study on fuel cell output power and hydrogen consumption was conducted for two propulsion schemes in case of hybrid and non-hybrid power source. In the hybrid propulsion scheme, supercapacitors were used as energy storage as they were charged from the fuel cell with constant current of 10 A.},

  abstract = {A detailed analysis of the power demand of an ultraefficient lightweight-battery electric vehicle is performed. The aim is to overcome the problem of lightweight electric vehicles that may have a relatively bad environmental impact if their power demand is not extremely reduced. In particular, electric vehicles have a higher environmental impact during the production phase, which should be balanced by a lower impact during the service life by means of a lightweight design. As an example of an ultraefficient electric vehicle, a prototype for the Shell Eco-marathon competition is considered. A “tank-to-wheel” multiphysics model (thermo-electro-mechanical) of the vehicle was developed in “Matlab-Simscape”. The model includes the battery, the DC motors, the motor controller and the vehicle drag forces. A preliminary model validation was performed by considering experimental data acquisitions completed during the 2019 Shell Eco-marathon European competition at the Brooklands Circuit (UK). Numerical simulations are employed to assess the sharing of the energy consumption among the main dissipation sources. From the analysis, we found that the main sources of mechanical dissipation (i.e., rolling resistance, gravitational/inertial force and aerodynamic drag) have the same role in the defining the power consumption of such kind of vehicles. Moreover, the effect of the main vehicle parameters (i.e., mass, aerodynamic coefficient and tire rolling resistance coefficient) on the energy consumption was analyzed through a sensitivity analysis. Results showed a linear correlation between the variation of the parameters and the power demand, with mass exhibiting the highest influence. The results of this study provide fundamental information to address critical decisions for designing new and more efficient lightweight vehicles, as they allow the designer to clearly identify which are the main parameters to keep under control during the design phase and which are the most promising areas of action.},

  abstract = {Shell Eco-Marathon (SEM) is an international competition among university students that involves designing, building, and driving energy-efficient cars. The car frame is the most crucial aspect influencing the strength of the car. This research aims to obtain maximum torsional strength with variations in the material and thickness of the frame. Calculation and testing are done using the simulation method to obtain a strong car frame. This simulation method is calculated by a series of finite element analyses. Then, data from the simulation method are obtained in the form of deformation and safety factors. By comparing the moment received with its deformation, torsional stiffness is then obtained. Furthermore, the torsional stiffness is divided by the weight to produce a value ratio. It is known that the factor which has the most significant influence on the difference in torsional stiffness of each variation is the shear modulus of the material used. In contrast, the weight of the chassis is influenced by the density of the material and the thickness of the chassis. Additionally, the safety factor of each variation is strongly influenced by the strength of the chassis structure itself. The results of this study will demonstrate the car frame design with the best performance.},

  abstract = {The increasing demand for energy efficient electric cars, in the automotive sector, entails the need for improvement of their structures, especially the chassis, because of its multifaceted role on the vehicle dynamic behaviour. The major criteria for the development of electric car chassis are the stiffness and strength enhancement subject to mass reduction as well as cost and time elimination. Towards this direction, this work indicates an integrated methodology of developing an electric car chassis considering the modeling and simulation concurrently. The chassis has been designed in compliance with the regulations of Shell Eco Marathon competition. This methodology is implemented both by the use of our chassis load calculator (CLC) model, which automatically calculates the total loads applied on the vehicle's chassis and by the determination of a worst case stress scenario. Under this extreme stress scenario, the model's output was evaluated for the chassis design and the FEA method was performed by the pre-processor ANSA and the solver Ansys. This method could be characterized as an accurate ultrafast and cost-efficient method.},

The car design has been provided by means of detailed 3D CFD modelling with Comsol Multiphysics®. The numerical tool has been validated against experiments conducted at the Laboratory of Industrial Measurements (LaMI) of the University of Cassino. In particular, a scale model of the car has been investigated in an open chamber wind tunnel by means of the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique, for different free stream velocities within the range 11 - 23 m/s. Measurements have been associated to a proper uncertainty analysis. The experimental data has been compared to numerical results obtained employing different turbulence models and the validated numerical tool has been applied to the simulation of the full-scale car model, allowing to analyse the wake flow structures, and estimate the overall drag coefficient.},

To win the competition, the fuel cell-powered propulsion system needs to be ultra efficient since the fuel cell system and transmission system are the key effects on the performance of the fuel cell-powered propulsion system. In this study, a high-efficiency fuel cell propulsion system has been designed and integrated in a prototype vehicle to participate the Shell Eco-marathon Asia 2018 race. To achieve that, the vehicle dynamic is modeled to make the selection of the key components, and some experiments have been conducted to obtain the properly vehicle driving strategy. Based on the results of vehicle dynamic analysis, a high specific power proton-exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack with 1000 W and a high-performance direct current (DC) brushless motor (1000 W) are selected to build the propulsion system of the Shell Eco-marathon vehicle. Based on the experimental result, the racing time (1300-1440 seconds) and varied range of racing speed (23-27 km/h) are selected as the driving strategy. Finally, the efficiency of the fuel cell-powered vehicle is analyzed. In the race at the year of 2018, the designed vehicle won the first place.},

  abstract = {Having a small car running with low power can be achieved by reducing the aerodynamics drag, rolling resistance and mechanical frictions between the moving parts. The Shell Eco-Marathon competition held around the world with events in Europe, USA and Asia shows every year new techniques and ideas to reduce the power needed to drive the car. The record of over 3400 km on the equivalent of a single litre of fuel is an indication of how car can run efficiently. The problem with these low drag cars is the driver perception about the shape of the car. Although the tear drop shape is known as having the minimum drag, practically this shape cannot be used due to size and packaging limitations in addition to the safety issue. In this work, a low drag concept car is proposed using initial CAD design. The concept car is examined using a commercial CFD software by simulating the airflow around car. The spatial distribution of the pressure and velocity vectors are utilized to improve the car shape and to achieve a low drag force coefficient while keeping the down force at its minimum value. By changing the car front, underneath and rear shapes, it was possible to reduce the drag coefficient from 0.430 for the baseline to 0.127 for the final design, while meeting the competition regulations.},

To model the drive-train, transmission ratio, engine torque and specific fuel consumption curves, mechanical efficiency of some rotating parts are also collected. Model of the vehicle is a close loop system in which engine as power unit gave its torque to wheel to move the vehicle. More speed developed by the engine would produce more resistance of vehicle dynamics. The calculations were conducted with changing vehicle speed, driver mode, and inclination of the track. Predictions of accuracy were done by using competition data from Sepang, Malaysia circuits within 5% of error.},
